# RPKI Validator / RTR Server
An RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) Validator is a tool used to verify the authenticity and validity of routing information by checking cryptographic certificates, ensuring the security and integrity of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing.
The RTR Server, on the other hand, provides real-time updates of validated RPKI data to routers.

You can find the WebUI of our public [Routinator](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/rpki/routinator/) instance [here](https://rpki.level66.network/).
If you want to use our RTR Server with your software or router, you may use the following details to setup the connection.

```
Server: rpki.level66.network
Port: 3323
