# Speedtest

We provide the followind speedtest servers to test the bandwidth of you to our network.

## LibreSpeed
We are using LibreSpeed as a web-based speedtest solution. Feel free to click [here](https://speedtest.noc.level66.network/) to test the performance to our network directly from your browser. Please be aware of wrong upload-measurements due to a [known issue with the implementation of LibreSpeed](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/issues/427).

## iPerf 3
We are offering a iPerf 3 server within our network which is more accurate as the web-based LibreSpeed speedtest mentioned above.

Port: 5201 (TCP and UDP)
```

## speedtest.net
We are part of the speedtest.net network. You may search for our company name (level66.network) on the speedtest.net site or within the apps to use our server for your measurements.
